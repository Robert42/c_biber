# c_biber
Small and trivial build system for C programs.

_Biber_ is the German name for beaver, a small cute mammal that loves building impressive structures out one of the most primitve building blocks: wood.

`c_biber` has no big goals. It just looks for a c compiler, watches one or more directories of c code and recompiles when something changed.

Warning: I am only intending to use this to bootstrap my own programming language, so I am going to abandon this project sooner or later.

Use at own risk.
